# 5 - What output would you expect when you run the command 'ls' in an empty folder? What about a folder containing files?
ls empty folder: The command would list nothing following the folder name because there are no files in the directory. 
ls folder with files: The command would list any files or folders the directory contained. 

# 6 - What is a quick way to create a new file?
touch

# 7 - Run 'git --version' in your terminal. What is the output?
git version 2.15.0

# 8 - Why would you run the command 'git status'?
git status shows any newly added files and/or folders for a specific branch. The command also shows which files or folders have been modified in a specific branch. 
I would run the command periodically to see if the changes I made in VSCode registered or were considered not staged (red) before the git add . command. 
Also, following the git add . command to ensure the changes on all the files were commited (turned green) and following the git commit -m "", to ensure the commit was registered. 

# 9 - What does the command 'git add .' do?
As I am working, changing or saving a file multiple times, the git add . adds any of those new or changed files in the directory I am working in to the staging area.
I would perform this command periodically, especially after testing new code to see if it was successful. 
When I am ready to finalize these changes and group them into a commmit, I would use git commit -m "message here", essentially creating a log of what the changes are. 

# 10 - What is the command to push your committed changes to your repo on GitHub?
git push origin main 
origin = a bookmark for GitHub
main = the branch I was working on
