<ul>
    <li>When I first watched the movie Fargo in high school, I scoffed at the way the Minnesotan accents were portrayed. It only took a few Missourians to point mine out during my undergraduate studies to prove me wrong. Upon moving to Virginia for my graduate degree, their mild southern drawl neutralized my strange, long o's. My accent quickly returned with a vengeance after I moved back in winter, weak from years of warm weather, cursing while chipping ice off my windshield.</li>
    <li>I have two cats, Oliver and Ichabod. Oliver (border) is a wise, empathic ten-year-old who can always sense emotions and comfort me. With his antics, Ichabod (pictured) reminded me I am capable of belly-laughing these past years.</li>
    <li>I am an artist and primarily a visual person. A self-described useless talent is identifying minor and pointless visual changes in shows and television. An example is during the movie Tommy Boy, Tommy Callahan is sitting in the dinghy, and his life vest switches back and forth, or a character's hair is styled slightly differently when the camera alternates shots.</li>

You are strong, but there is a flaw in your strength, and unless you learn to control it the flaw will prove stronger than your strength and defeat you. - Truman Capote, In Cold Blood</p></footer>
