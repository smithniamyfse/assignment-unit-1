<ul>
    <li>When I first watched Fargo in high school, I scoffed at the way the Minnesotan accents were portrayed. During my undergraduate studies, even Missourians pointed mine out. Upon moving to Virginia for my graduate degree, their mild southern drawl neutralized my strange O's in 'boat' and 'phone.' My accent quickly returned with a vengeance after I moved back in winter, weak from years of warm weather, cursing while chipping ice off my windshield.</li>
    <li>I have two cats, Oliver and Ichabod. Oliver is a wise, empathic ten-year-old who can always sense and comfort me. With his antics, Ichabod (pictured) reminded me I am capable of belly-laughing these past years.</li>
    <li>I am an artist and primarily a visual person. A self-described useless talent is identifying minor and pointless visual changes in shows and television. An example is during the movie Tommy Boy, Tommy Callahan is sitting in the dinghy, and his life vest switches back and forth, or when a character's hair is styled slightly differently when the camera alternates shots.</li>
